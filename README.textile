h1. Hash vs EhCache vs Hazelcast vs Infinispan

h2. Overview

This is just a simple benchmark to compare "Hazelcast":http://www.hazelcast.com, "EhCache":http://ehcache.org/ and "Infinispan":http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/ performance (with defaults), and includes a regular Hash object as a baseline.

The benchmark contains of two part that are repeated for the several cache implementations multiple time.
Data is put in the cache during the first part and data is read from the cache during the second part of the benchmark.

h2. Usage

You can just start it up:

bc. ./gradlew clean test -i
